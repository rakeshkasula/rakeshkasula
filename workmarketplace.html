        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Many individual workers and small vendors struggle to reliably reach customers, while customers often
          rely on word-of-mouth or unstructured channels to find trusted services. There is a gap in
          <strong>structured, analytics-driven marketplaces</strong> that make it easier to match demand and
          supply and measure performance in a transparent way.
        </p>

      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
        <p>
          WorkMarketplace.co is a <strong>two-sided platform</strong> that connects workers/vendors with
          customers across categories. The platform is designed from day one with
          <strong>analytics and measurement embedded</strong> into the workflows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Structured worker and customer profiles with service categories and skills.</li>
          <li>Booking workflow with events that track searches, views, requests, confirmations, and completions.</li>
          <li>Dashboards to monitor marketplace health: requests, fulfillment, repeat usage, and ratings.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>My Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Defined the marketplace structure, workflows, and key product flows.</li>
          <li>Designed the data model for users, services, bookings, and transactions.</li>
          <li>Implemented analytics events and built reporting views and dashboards.</li>
          <li>Worked on the front-end experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for early MVP pages.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Data & Analytics Design</h2>
        <p>
          The core of WorkMarketplace.co is the ability to <strong>measure and improve matching</strong>
          over time. Some of the key analytics components:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Event tracking:</strong> Search, listing views, profile opens, booking requests, acceptance,
            completion, cancellation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Funnel views:</strong> Worker and customer funnels from visit → request → completed booking.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quality metrics:</strong> Completion rate, response time, rating distributions by category.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Operations dashboards:</strong> Daily/weekly active users, open requests, unmatched demand.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Architecture Snapshot</h2>
        <p>(High-level MVP architecture)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Front-end prototype with HTML/CSS/JS (extensible to React/SPA later).</li>
          <li>Backend APIs / services to store users, services, bookings, and ratings.</li>
          <li>Relational database (SQL) for core transactional data.</li>
          <li>Analytics layer using SQL + BI tools (e.g., Power BI) for dashboards.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Impact & Learnings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Built a clear view of marketplace supply and demand by category, enabling better prioritization of
            worker onboarding and marketing efforts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed a data model that can scale with new service categories and geographies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strengthened my experience combining <strong>data engineering, analytics, and product thinking</strong>
            in a real product, not just in isolated projects.

      <section class="case-section">
        <h2>What’s Next</h2>
        <p>
          Future iterations include experimenting with <strong>recommendation models</strong> for
          worker-customer matching, automated quality alerts (e.g., sudden rating drops), and more advanced
          cohort analysis to understand retention and repeat usage.
